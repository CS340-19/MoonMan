## Introduction
  The goal of MoonMan was to create a 2-D pixel art style side scrolling game, in which the enemies attach in waves that the player must survive. We have stayed on track with the goal and haven't had any major changes in our original plan. Through the development of our game we have made great strides and are nearing the beta stage, where our base game is almost finished and our development and issues will be focused on adding new features and debugging. The team members knowledge of the java language has grown tremendously and this has helped to implement the more complicated issues that are arising now in the development. We feel that we have reached a stage of what we would consider our game to be at our minimun acceptable point and believe we have enough time to implement almost all of the features and meet most of the goals we had when we began this project. The plan laid out at the beginning has been tweaked slightly as we move through issues and milestones, and we have had to reevaluate the timeline of some of the steps of development. As issues and features would be implemented it would become apparent that some things would need to wait and some would need to be solved sooner rather than later. 
  The team has actually been rather surprised at how smoothly most things have gone and we have not yet hit any major hurdles that we could not overcome. We dealt with quite a few bugs and issues during the beginning sprints due to all of the team members working in Java for the first time, but as time progressed and the team became more skilled in Java we have run into far less bugs.
  The final base game issue that must be solved is implementing a random enemy spawing method, most likely using "spawn pockets" so that enemies appear when players enter certain areas of the level. This has been the only issue that we have had to reevaluate which method we wanted to use to spawn enemies. 
  After this has been added, we will be to a stage in which any further development will be debugging and adding features to keep gameplay interesting.

## Team
**Description**

The teams experience in other programming languages has been vital in team members learing and becoming proficient in Java. This was expected when we began this project and we knew that even though no one had a lot of experience in Java, our experience in other programming languages would be very helpful. All team members now feel comfortable working in Java and are able to implement features of the game without much issue. 

**Individual Background/Contributions:** 
- **Dylan Lee:** Dylan is a undergraduate student in his junior year, majoring in Computer Science. His experience includes 2.5 years of programming in C and C++, as well as some simple C++ game development in his free time. Although he is not well versed in Java, his expereince will allow an easy transition to the new language.   
- **Antonio Vega:** Antonio is from a small town called McKenzie located in West Tennessee. He is a junior undergraduate majoring in Computer Science. Prior to attending undergraduate studies, he had no experience programming whatsoever. Skills include: programming in C/C++, Photoshop and Lightroom. Currently learning about systems programming, automata, and operting systems.
  - **Contribution/Implementation** So far, Antonio has helped in implementing/creating the mouse input class, menu and options screens, and sound files. The mouse input class was built using Java's libraries such as MouseAdapter and MouseEvent. This class helps detect and track mouse input from the user. As far as what the user/player uses the mouse in the game, it helps with navigation of the game using appropiate boxes for certain options in the menus. Once the player is in the game itself, the mouse is mapped to actions such as click to shoot, as well as aiming with the cursor. For the menu and options screens, Antonio implemented the options menu that the player can access from the either the menu or pause menu (As of now, the options sub-menu has only been implemented for the main menu splash screen when the game is initially executated.). These options include sound levels, difficulty, and tutorial options that the user can toggle to his or her desire. As for the sound file playback, it was created using Java's built in libraries, such as Clip, AudioInputStream, and AudioSystem. With this implementation, all audio files are .wav files as this is the format that the libraries support. Sound playback is used to throughout the whole game, from navigation to playing the game itself, sounds such as when the player jumps, shoots, kills enemy, and background music. 
- **Julian Ball:** Julian started programming his freshman year and has learned about C/C++, vim, Python and is currently learning about shell scripts. he has recently been doing research that requires basic knowledge of machine learning concepts and would like to continue learning about artificial intelligence. Julian also is very interested in game development and is excited to be a part of this project.
- **Zach McMichael:** Zach is an undergraduate student who is proficient in C and C++. He has been in the process of learning Java and Python on his own time to further is knowlege of programing. He will be heading up using Piskell to create and manifest all of the characters, animations, and backgrounds for the project this semester. 
- **Adam Tutko:** Adam is an undergraduate in pursuit of his Bachelor in Computer Science. He has 2 and a half years of experience programming in C++/C and has a firm grasp on HTML and CSS as well as some experience in Python. Though he lacks any prior experience with Java, his solid programming foundation will lend itself to a quick and solid understanding of the language.

**Summary**

Overall we have really enjoyed developing the game and feel very satisfied with the progress we have made. We have not had to deviate from our original plan at all and we are very happy that we have not gotten stuck on any issues.
