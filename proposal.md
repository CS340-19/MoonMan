Introduction:
The project will be a 2-D side-scrolling video game in which waves of enemies will attack the player. The goal will be survival and getting the highest score. The motivation behind the project is to apply the groupâ€™s current programming abilities to build a custom game. A substantial motivating factor behind this was the want to create something unique and custom that is also based on the personal interests of each group member. The game will be implemented in Java to further the group members experience in a new programming language. This language will also allow for a smoother implementation of the project by utilizing the robust libraries already in existence. The project, while unique, is not a new concept. It will visually resemble some critically acclaimed games such as Mario while encompassing the battle style of Super Smash Bros. This will allow for a robust combat system while still allowing the vision to be implemented accurately. 

While this game will be a side-scroller it will not be designed as a platformer; instead, it will consist of one endless level in which waves of enemies attack the player. The player will have a selection of different weapons to combat the enemies, ranging from close range melee weapons to long-range projectile weapons. As the player makes further progress in the game by eliminating enemies, the option to upgrade their character and weapons will be provided. As the player progresses, the enemies will also increase in strength and number. This will allow for a simple way of increasing difficulty, without having to implement more features. The game will have a space theme, where the main character will be a spaceman in a moon suit similar to the ones used when landing on the moon. The enemies will be a multitude of different aliens designed with many different styles. 

To implement this game, the group will be programming in Java. This language will allow easy access to graphics libraries so that more focus can be put on the gameplay mechanics. The combat mechanics of the game will be based on hit-box detection and will utilize many different weapons. To create the appearance of an endless side-scrolling level, a base level will be designed and then replicated over and over. When the player walks to the edge of the game window, the screen shall move in the opposite direction to simulate movement. However, there shall be a window of movement in the middle of the screen for the character to move without the screen moving. This window will allow for a more smooth looking design when in combat. 


Customer Value:
This product is a widely recognized medium of entertainment called video gaming. It is a pass time that is done worldwide. The specific genre of videogame that was decided on, a side-scrolling two-dimensional game, has produced many beloved works over the years. Some examples of this would be Super Mario Brothers, Castlevania, and Sonic the Hedgehog. All of these games have received acclaim. Geek.com states "When people discuss their favorite video games of all time, there will no doubt be a number of side-scrollers mentioned." and then continues "...love them or hate them- there is no questioning their impact on gaming or the fact that some amazing side-scrollers have been released". As a form of entertainment, side-scrolling video games are a relatively easily implemented project. However, even though this genre is more easily implemented, it still holds a place of value in peoples hearts and minds. This means that while the product will not be entirely original, it already has a niche that could allow it to thrive.

Alongside this fact, the format of 2-D sidescrollers allows for a level of artistic license on how characters are designed. Pleasing and original ascetics appeal to the market much more than a standard visual representation. Often the art style of a game plays a significant role in how well its target audience receives it. The use of shading or less realistic representations of humans in three-dimensional games often helps its production. Examples of games that have taken advantage of this and have gained acclaim include Borderlands, Life is Strange, and the Walking Dead. These games are however limited slightly by the requirement to maintain the correct human form. Pixel art has more leeway in this area and therefore allows for a style that is closer in line with our vision. 

Overall, the benefits of choosing the 2-D sidescrolling format far outweigh the potential drawbacks. There are many examples of sidescrollers doing exceptionally well in recent years. One such example that stands out is Shovel Knight. It is a game closely follows the Castlevania style but puts a unique spin on it to make it stand alone. So, while achieving the same level of acclaim of past greats might not be likely, this product still has a place in the gaming industry. Alongside this, since there were previous iterations of our idea, excellent examples from which to draw inspiration are abundant. There is still plenty of room for an original spin on the genre. This means that utilizing previous work will be simple and allow for a clean implementation of the project without tainting to look too much like other works.
