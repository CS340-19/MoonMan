Introduction:
The project will be a 2-D side-scrolling video game in which the player will be attacked by waves of enemies with the goal of survival and getting the highest score. The motivation behind the project is to apply the groupâ€™s current programming abilities to build a custom game. The freedom to create something completely unique and custom that is also based on the personal interests of group members is also a large motivating factor. The game will be implemented in Java to further the group members experience in a new programming language. The project, while unique, is not a new concept. It will visually resemble some very popular games such as Mario, while encompassing the battle style of Super Smash Bros. 

While this game will be a side-scroller it will not be designed as a platformer, rather, it will consist of one endless level in which waves of enemies attack the player. The player will have a selection of different weapons to combat the enemies, ranging from close range melee weapons to long range projectile weapons. As the player makes further progress in the game by eliminating enemies, they will have the option to upgrade their character and weapons. As the player progresses the enemies will also increase in strength and number. The game will have a space theme, where the main character and the enemies will be different forms of aliens. 

To implement this game, the group will be programming in Java. It will allow easy access to graphics libraries so that more focus can be put on the game play mechanics. The combat mechanics of the game will be based on hit-box detection. To create the appearance of an endless side-scrolling level, a base level will be designed and then replicated over and over when the player walks to the edge of the game window.
